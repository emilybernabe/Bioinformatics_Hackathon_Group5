# Task A. Connect with your team.

Group Members: Emily Bernabe, Taylor Nutzman, Zoe Vickery, Rachel Anderson, and Julia Bertarelli

# Task B. Select a disease to study.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition that affects red blood cells. 

# Task C. Find a gene underlying the disease.

The underlying cause of sickle cell disease is a single mutation in the β-globin gene (HBB). The mutation is a single nucleotide change, GAG to GTG, in the sixth codon of this gene. HBB is located on chromosome 11 and codes for the β-globin protein, which is an essential component of hemoglobin. 

# Task D. Build a protein:protein interaction (PPI) network using the known gene protein product(s) as seeds.

# Task E. Find tissue-specific eQTLs DNA polymorphisms that could alter the expression of the candidate genes.

# Task F. Construct an hypothesis that the genes caused the disease phenotype by mechanism X.
